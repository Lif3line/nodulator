The Nodulator
=========

A Javascript project that produces an animated canvas based on an image. The image is converted to a bunch of coloured nodes which dynamically move away from the mouse when hovering and towards it when mouse is held or clicked.

Installation
========

Simply download all the files and either upload them to a server, run them on a local server or straight from the local repository. If running from the local repository however there may be some permission issues. To counter-act this you must allow file to file access. For instance with chrome run with the parameter --allow-file-access-from-files.

Background Theory
========

If you're interested then once the nodes are created they act as a simple agents based model where each node is an agent and the mouse is a system input. Each frame of animation the nodes are updated based on their current position and the current input.
