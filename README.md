The Nodulator
=========

A Javascript project that produces an animated canvas based on an image. The image is converted to a bunch of coloured nodes which dynamically move away from the mouse when hovering and towards it when mouse is held or clicked. Optionally lines may also be drawn between nearby nodes.

Everything that is needed to see it in action is included.
